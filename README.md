# N-Puzzle-Game-2022
N-puzzle solver that can solve any N-puzzle (different dimensions) by using A* search algorithm EFFICENTLY to solve it in the least time possible after determining if the puzzle is solvable or not, in addition you can track all the moves made to reach this best solution and you can solve the puzzle on your own through a friendly GUI.
the aim of this project to solve the puzzle with the least number of moves by using A* search algorithm and priority queue , there is detailed analysis for the code in the word file ("analysis_of_the_code")
!!! the priority_queue works on .NET 6 !!!
